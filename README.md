# advent_of_code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) offers an advent calendar of coding exercises. This is my implementation for solving some of them.

## Prerequisites

I solved the exercises using Python 3.6. Running scripts using python2 may not work.

If necessary, you may setup your Python virtual environmment and install requirements via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions

Each exercise has its own folder. Following commands can be run from this folder.

### Testing

Unit tests can be run:
```
pytest test.py
```
Most of the unit tests are inspired from examples given in the exercises outlines.

### Running

Each exercise is composed of two sub-problems. Both answers will be printed in the console with
```
python3 ex.py
```
